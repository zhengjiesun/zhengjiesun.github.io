## Research Interests

- Scattered Data Approximation
- Radial basis function
- Meshless methods
- Structure-preserving methods

We focuses on the theories and applications of kernel-based meshless methods. In particular, we study the interpolation and quasi-interpolation schemes of radial basis functions, develop meshless structure-preserving algorithms for time-dependent PDEs. Recently, my interests are on the **high-dimensional function approximation**, **numerical solutions for PDEs on manifolds**.
