    <li>Scattered Data Approximation</li>

<p style="font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;">
We focuses on the theories and applications of kernel-based meshless methods. In particular, we study the interpolation and quasi-interpolation schemes of radial basis functions, develop meshless structure-preserving algorithms for time-dependent PDEs. Recently, my interests are on the <strong>high-dimensional function approximation</strong>, <strong>numerical solutions for PDEs on manifolds</strong>.
